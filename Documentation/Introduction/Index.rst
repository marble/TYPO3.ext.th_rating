What does it do?
----------------

This extension provides a rating plugin for every type of content in the
database. Every field of every table can be defined as a so-called
'ratingobject' that can be used for ratings. The extension could be
included as a normal content plugin to have ratings of the content page.
Nevertheless the best usecase is to integrate it as a cObj in your own
extension. This extension features the future oriented extensions
extbase and fluid. It is expected to adopt it in a easy way to new
versions of TYPO3. It is inspired by the extension 'ratings' from Dmitry
Dulepov and the incredible tutorial about CSS star rating technique from
"Komodomedia":http://www.komodomedia.com/blog/2007/01/css-star-rating-redux/
