This extension does mainly target developers (website administrators and
extension developers) but you can also easily use this rating directly
on pages as a content element.

#. Create a new content element of the type "Insert Plugin"

#. Choose the extension "Rating AX" in the dropdownbox

#. Configure your rating

   The concerned ratingobject in that mode uses ``tt_content`` as tablename and ``uid`` as fieldname. You may first configure the ratingsteps you 
   like to have. Be aware using ongoing positive integer ratingorder numbers.

   If you are working on multilanguage websites you may add translations of your ratingsteps as usual:

   Important: DonÂ´t forget adding the additional language you want to add to the list of pagelanguages in your storagepage.
